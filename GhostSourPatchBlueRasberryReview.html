      <caption>Ghost Sour Patch Blue Raspberry Review - 2.9 / 10</caption>
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 30px; line-height: 35px; text-align: justify;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Sunday
          morning, I taste tested the Ghost Sour Patch Blue Raspberry energy drink. I came in with high expectations
          since other flavors of Ghost I&rsquo;ve tried (orange cream and faze pop) have been absolutely delicious.
          Ghost generally has a good kick to it despite a modest 200 mg of caffeine.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with Ghost Sour Patch Blue
          Rasberry I was severely disappointed. I am generally a fan of candy flavored drinks (C4 Starburst and C4
          Skittles especially) but the sour patch flavor did not agree with me. I do like the actual sour patch candy
          but to me this drink did not accurately reflect the flavor of Sour Patch. I also like the taste of
          raspberries, they are one of only two fruits I actually like, the other being blueberries. Ghost Sour Patch
          Blue Rasberry was a poor reflection of both flavors they were trying to imitate. The combination of these
          two flavors did not mix well together.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only redeeming factor of this
          drink is the solid energy kick it gave. The beta alanine in Ghost drinks does a good job of making it feel
          like your face is being constantly pricked by the time you&rsquo;re halfway through the can. Despite that,
          Ghost has missed the mark with this flavor and I am giving this drink a 2.9 out of 10.
