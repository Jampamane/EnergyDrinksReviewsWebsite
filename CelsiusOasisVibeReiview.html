      <caption>Celsius Oasis Vibe Review - 5.4 / 10</caption>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For full clarity, this review is of
          the Celsius Oasis Vibe &lsquo;Sparkling Prickly Pear Lime&rsquo; Edition. I&rsquo;m not aware if there are
          other Celsius Oasis Vibe editions and I do not feel like researching it.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can is among the mixed variety
          pack of Celsius drinks I got so I could review a variety of Celsius drinks. Unfortunately, I got busy with
          life stuff and haven&rsquo;t reviewed the other Celsius drinks so apologies to the readers. I will come back
          and review those at a future date.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can of Celsius has a catchy
          title and can design.
          <br>
          <br>
          It&rsquo;s definitely one of the more visually appealing cans I have seen. Points
          given for that. The taste didn&rsquo;t have a very strong kick to it, I had to really focus on the taste to
          pick it up. Upon focusing on it, I could taste the hints of the pear and lime. I don&rsquo;t personally like
          most fruits including pear and lime so I didn&rsquo;t expect to like the flavor however I was pleasantly
          surprised. The flavor combination agreed with my taste buds and I wasn&rsquo;t mad at it. However, I
          wouldn&rsquo;t say the taste was very memorable and I will remember this one more for the can design.
