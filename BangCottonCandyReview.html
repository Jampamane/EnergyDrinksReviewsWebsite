      <caption>Bang Cotton Candy Review - 9.2 / 10</caption>

        <td style="padding: 30px; line-height: 35px; text-align: justify;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start off by saying I&rsquo;m
          very glad to see Bang back in stores again. They had some incredible flavors and with an incredible 300 mg
          of caffeine per can, they were an excellent choice to start off one&rsquo;s day during a slow morning or a
          bad night&rsquo;s sleep. The cotton candy flavored Bang was one of my favorites, and I only recently saw it
          back on shelves when shopping at Weis for a grocery haul. I excitedly grabbed a can knowing that this was
          going to make for an incredible Sunday morning.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it did not disappoint. The cotton
          candy flavor was exactly how I remembered it. There&rsquo;s a wonderful sweetness to the drink but its also
          not overpowering. I&rsquo;m personally a huge fan of candy flavored drinks (other favorites of mine include
          C4&rsquo;s Skittles and Starburst flavored drinks). Bang perfectly captured the cotton candy flavor in this
          one and each sip leaves you wanting more.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course the best part of Bang
          drinks is the insane kick. I&rsquo;m someone who likes to slowly sip on energy drinks and space out the
          caffeine rush. Despite that, I felt the power of the drink very quickly. Perfect drink to get you going for
          a busy day ahead in my opinion. The comedown isn&rsquo;t as bad as other drinks as well, leaving you enough
          energy for later in the day when the kick wears off. This drink is one of my absolute favorites and I am
          giving Bang Cotton Candy a score of 9.2 out of 10.
