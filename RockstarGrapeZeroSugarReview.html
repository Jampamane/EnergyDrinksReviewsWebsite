          Rockstar Grape Zero is&hellip; pretty damn good. If you like
          grape flavored things, you&rsquo;re gonna love this one. Rockstar is one of those drinks in my opinion that
          always flies under the radar below Monster and Red Bull. Which is strange to me since Rockstar usually goes
          for a buck or sometimes two depending on where you live.

          This drink definitely packs a solid punch at 240 mgs of caffeine. Definitely a solid
          go-to on days where I haven&rsquo;t had enough sleep. The odd thing though is despite having more caffeine
          than drinks like C4, it doesn&rsquo;t pack as hard a punch as C4. But still&hellip;definitely strong enough
          of a kick to get you going in the morning.

          Taste itself will be hit or miss depending on if you like grape flavored stuff.
          I&rsquo;m definitely a huge fan of grape flavored things, so I really like this one. There is definitely a
          bit of an artificial taste there but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I&rsquo;m giving this drink a 7.8 / 10.
