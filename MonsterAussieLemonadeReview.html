      <caption>Monster Aussie Lemonade Review - 1.8 / 10</caption>

        <td style="padding: 30px; line-height: 35px; text-align: justify;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning everyone. Today I am
          reviewing the Monster Aussie Lemonade energy drink. This drink was specifically requested from a fan&rsquo;s
          recommendation - so I stopped by a WaWa&rsquo;s and found this drink to review. Researching this drink on
          Monster&rsquo;s website, their description of this drink is as follows - &ldquo;Inspired by the land down
          under and powered by our world-famous Monster Energy blend, Aussie Style Lemonade is a carbonated exotic
          twist on lemonade. Tart yet sweet, with a burst of fresh citrus flavor.&rdquo; Interestingly, I also
          discovered that this flavor of Monster will be discontinued soon and will be going away sometime in
          2025.

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the can, I think this is
          one of the most eye popping designs I have ever seen. There are a number of sea creatures with a bright blue
          background that are fun to look at. Looking at the can&rsquo;s nutrition label - I noticed this can has 46
          grams of sugar. I usually review and drink sugar free energy drinks (with the rare exception of Rockstar
          Fruit Punch) so I thought this would be an interesting one to review.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I took my first sip of this can, I was
          absolutely horrified. I thought the flavor was extremely unpleasant. The combination of the lemonade
          flavoring which was a little sour combined with the sugar in the drink did not go well together. The first
          initial taste I got from each sip was a sour kick and then followed up by the sweet aftertaste.
          Unfortunately, I was not able to finish this drink as I did not enjoy it. I understand why it is being
          discontinued. For these reasons, I am giving this drink a score of 1.8 out of 10.
