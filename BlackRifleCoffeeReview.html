      <caption>Black Rifle Coffee Review - 9.6 / 10</caption>

        <td style="padding: 30px; line-height: 35px; text-align: justify;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week&rsquo;s review is a special
          July 4th edition (a little late, I know). Today I am reviewing Black Rifle&rsquo;s Rich Mocha Coffee. Black
          Rifle&rsquo;s branding is absolutely on point with a giant american flag on the can along with a slogan of
          &ldquo;serving coffee and culture to people who love america&rdquo; and a warning of &ldquo;300 mg of
          freedom fuel&rdquo;. Excellent stuff.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth noting that some energy drink traditionalists
          argue that coffee
          based drinks should not count as energy drinks and I have mixed feelings on this topic. Perhaps a discussion
          for another time.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I patriotically sipped my Black Rifle Coffee, my first
          thought was that it was
          absolutely delicious. I&rsquo;m not usually a coffee person but this coffee has a wonderful creaminess and
          flavor to it. The &ldquo;Rich Mocha&rdquo; label did not disappoint and the taste was exactly such. For
          coffee lovers who are not big energy drink fans I think that this can be a great gateway into the energy
          drink world.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the energy hit of this can to be absolutely insane.
          Downed the drink with no
          breakfast first thing on a Sunday morning, and felt like my head was going to explode. Whatever is in this
          &ldquo;freedom fuel&rdquo; is some powerful stuff. Highly recommend this drink, Black Rifle Coffee has
          become one of my absolute favorites.
