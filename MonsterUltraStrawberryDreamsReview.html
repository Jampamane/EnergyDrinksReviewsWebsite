      <caption>Monster Ultra Strawberry Dreams Review - 7.8/10</caption>

        <td style="padding: 30px; line-height: 35px; text-align: justify;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking down the self checkout
          lines at Target, the Monster Ultra Strawberry Dream energy drink can caught my eye. It was a bright pink can
          with an aesthetically pleasing design. My fish brain was instantly attracted to it and between that and the
          pressure of my many fans (all three of them) clamoring for a new review, I knew I had to buy it.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first took a sip, I was
          pleasantly surprised. If the fans read my last review on the Celsius Strawberry lemonade, they&rsquo;ll know
          that I&#39;m not the biggest fan of strawberry flavored things. Despite that, I thought the taste of Monster
          Ultra Strawberry Dreams was pretty damn good. The light strawberry kick left a pleasant taste in my mouth
          and I wanted to down the rest of it immediately.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say I enjoyed this flavor of
          Monster better than most of the other flavors of theirs I tried and this is a can that I would get again.
          The main drawback for me is the lack of kick to it. This can contains a mere 110mg of caffeine per
          can..slightly more than a cup of coffee. If you have a serious caffeine addiction like me, that is just not
          going to cut it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m docking a few points off the score.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, overall this is an
          excellent drink. The can was aesthetically pleasing (which does factor into my review in case anyone is
          wondering) and the taste was pretty good. 7.8 out of 10 for me, would buy again.
