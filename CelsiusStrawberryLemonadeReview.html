      <caption>Celsius Strawberry Lemonade Review - 4/10</caption>
      <tr>
        <td style="padding: 30px; line-height: 35px; text-align: justify;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celsius is a brand I am generally a
          fan of. I don&rsquo;t get their drinks very often (Rockstar is what I usually get) however I do acknowledge
          that they do a good job with having a wide variety of flavors. I ordered a pack of assorted Celsius drinks
          off Amazon so I could try a bunch of different flavors. So to all of this website&rsquo;s dedicated fans
          (all three of you), expect the next set of reviews to be of different Celsius flavors for the coming few
          weeks.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that I first tried is the
          strawberry lemonade flavor. I thought the flavor was &hellip;ok. I&rsquo;ll admit I don&rsquo;t generally
          like strawberry and lemonade that much so this flavor never had a huge change of me giving it a high score.
          This drink to me had a much stronger lemonade flavor and I only caught hints of strawberry while I was
          sipping it. Although I don&rsquo;t like strawberry or lemonade I would have preferred a stronger strawberry
          taste than lemonade.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the flavors Celsius has I
          think this one is one of the weaker ones in their repertoire. If you are a person who loves lemonade and
          strawberries you might love this one but in my opinion, Celsius has much better flavors out there.
          Can&rsquo;t speak to the energy kick as I&rsquo;m only halfway through the can while writing this review but
          usually Celsius gives a decent hit (though not as much as Reign/Bang of course). For these reasons I must
          sadly give Celsius Strawberry Lemonade a mere 4 out of 10.
